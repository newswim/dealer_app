<!-- TODO:
- add a favicon (done)
- function that requires the reCAPTCHA (done)
- copy 'Legal Name' field into 'Company' field (semi-finished)
- comply to Leads schema ...or create custom module (done)
- add 'all filds required unless otherwise indicated' to top section
- mark all optional fields as optional
- seems like 'Form of Business' field isn't getting added
- form should also reflect which fields are mandatory in vTiger module, ie.
  - html element name == 'Webforms reference Field' -->

We may ask you for: your name, title or position, email address, mailing address, phone number, financial information, and other personal information as appropriate. Additionally, we may request information about the SAVI Controls products you use, or third-party products connected to your SAVI Controls system, such as model or serial numbers. In the case of a technical issue, we may also collect information relating to a support or service incident. Please note that we do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal information relating to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality; please do provide any of this type of information to us.</p>
        <h5>B.	Information Collected Automatically</h5>
        <p>To measure and improve the performance of our Sites, we may collect information during your visit to the Sites through our automatic data collection tools, which may include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, pixel tags and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools help us track how users are interacting with our Sites, and help us make your visit to our Sites easier and more efficient by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. SAVI Controls maintains its own pages on many social networking sites, and we may also collect information from you when you interact with our social networking pages.</p>
        <h5>C.	Use of Cookies and Other Web Tracking Technologies</h5>
        <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of data stored on a user's device. When you visit the Sites, SAVI Controls may place a "cookie" on your device which allows us to compile information about Sites usage and to recognize you when you visit the Sites again. In addition, we use pixel tags "tiny graphic images " to tell us what parts of our Sites our users have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches performed on our Sites. This information can be used to enhance the content of the Sites and make your experience more informative. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that users can read and tell us whether emails have been opened to help assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our users. If you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your email address, we will associate our cookies and tags with that information and you will no longer be an anonymous visitor to the Sites.</p>
        <p>In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Sites. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in our email messages.</p>
        <p>Like many other companies, we use third party partners to analyze data collected about your browsing behavior when you visit our Sties. Our Sites may include technology from Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics, Quantcast, Elaqua, Hubspot and other similar technologies. These tools provide us with analytical information, reports and analysis about the use of our Sites, and may record the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, the type of device and operating system you are using, your general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our Site, such as the page that led you to our Sites, how often you visit pages within our Sites and other data related to the use of our Sites.

        <h5>D.	Do Not Track Features</h5>
        <p>Some web browsers may let you enable a "do not track" feature that sends signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will update our Privacy Policy and describe to describe our response. More information about "do not track" is available at www.allaboutdnt.org.

        <p>YOU ALSO AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF THE RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES, FORM A MATERIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED TO YOU FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
        <h4>13. Exclusions</h4>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This Agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this Agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

        <h4>16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial</h4>
        <p>This Agreement and any claims arising hereunder will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, excluding principles of conflict or choice of law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you and SAVI Controls hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any Texas state court or United States federal court, in either case sitting in Texas over any suit, action or other proceeding brought by you, a third party, or SAVI Controls arising out of or relating to these Terms, and you and SAVI Controls hereby irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts. THE PARTIES HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED AMONG THEM. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court or other tribunal \(including, without limitation, contract claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims, and all other common law and statutory claims). THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND RELATED DOCUMENTS, OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THIS TRANSACTION OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.</p>
        <h4>17. Miscellaneous</h4>
        <p>This Agreement represents the entire agreement between you and SAVI Controls with respect to your use, and SAVI Controls’ provision, of the Website and the Software and Services, and its terms supersede and replace any prior or contemporaneous written or oral statements by SAVI Controls or its representatives, dealers, or resellers. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The official text of this Agreement or notice submitted hereunder shall be in English. In the event of any dispute concerning the construction or meaning of this Agreement, reference shall be made only to this Agreement as written in English and not to any translation into another language, and this Agreement will not be construed against the drafting party. You may not amend this Agreement except in a writing signed by SAVI Controls. You may not assign, sublicense or transfer any of your rights and obligations under this Agreement to a third party without SAVI Controls’ prior written consent. Any attempted assignment, sublicense, or transfer without the prior written consent of SAVI Controls shall be null and void. SAVI Controls’ failure to enforce any of the terms of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver or relinquishment of SAVI Controls’ right to do so at any time. Sections 4(b), 5, 9, and 11 - 16 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
